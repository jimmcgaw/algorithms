# Algorithms

I need a refresher on fundamental algorithms. This repo is a collection of implementations. The implementations themselves are derived from the popular Cormen textbook. I'm going to focus on Python, using the base unittest library as a testing framework.

If for some reason you've found this repo, be advised that this library should *not* be used to solve your algorithm problems. This is strictly an academic project for myself. You'll find better (e.g. more performant) implementations of these in the standard Python modules or in other 3rd-party libs.

## Running a test

For example: ``` $ python datastructures/test_stack.py ```

Or to run all tests (using [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/)) from root dir:

``` $ py.test ```
